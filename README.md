<h2>LandTrack Measurements</h2>
<p>Make a LandTract class with the following fields:  • length - an int containing the tract's length • width - an int containing the tract's width  The class should also have the following methods:  • area - returns an int representing the tract's area • equals - takes another LandTract object as a parameter and returns a boolean saying whether or not the two tracts have the same dimensions (This applies regardless of whether the dimensions match up. i.e., if the length of the first is the same as the width of the other and vice versa, that counts as having equal dimensions.) • toString - returns a String with details about the LandTract object in the format: LandTract object with length 30 and width 40 (If, for example, the LandTract object had a length of 30 and a width of 40.)  Write a separate program that asks the user to enter the dimensions for the two tracts of land (in the order length of the first, width of the first, length of the second, width of the second). The program should print the output of two tracts' toString methods followed by a sentence stating whether or not the tracts have equal dimensions. (If the tracts have the same dimensions, print, "The two tracts have the same size." Otherwise, print, "The two tracts do not have the same size.") Print all three statements on separate lines.</p>
